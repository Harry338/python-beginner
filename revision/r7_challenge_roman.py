# Task:
#   using what you have learn in r7, code a program which
#   gets a roman numeral from the user with input()
#   and converts it into an integer

# Examples:
#   input = V,  output = 5
#   input = IV, output = 4
#   input = X,  output = 10
#   we will only do I, V, X

# Logic:
#   there are many ways to program this but you could do this:
#   first make a loop to consider every character in the string
#
#   you can make a variable called 'total'
#   in each loop, you can add the roman numeral value to the 'total'


#   depending on the next character, you can remove some value or add 
#   a value to total

user_input = input("Give me a roman numeral to convert into a integer")
