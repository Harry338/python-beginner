# Choose a mathematical equation and code it so that it gives as result
# For eg:
# You can choose a pythagoras theorem, which gets 2 numbers from the user 
# and prints out the result.

# If you make you own equation, make 3 of them
# of eg: y = x^2 = 30

# if you are using square root, you can use 'import math'
# and google how to use sqrt

import math
print("Square Root Calculator")

number = float(input("Enter a number:\n"))
answer = number**(1/2)
print("Square Root is",answer)
